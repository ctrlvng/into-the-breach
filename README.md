# Into the (HIPAA) Breach

If I asked, you’d probably say credit card breaches are the worst, right? Since your credit could be ruined forever?

HIPAA breaches are serious too, though the consequences may not be as readily apparent. Like with credit card breaches, one possible consequence is identity theft, but even more concerning is if a breach involves malware designed to harm a system – the consequences could be disruptive and devastating, especially for more vulnerable populations.

### About the Datasets

The data comes from the Office of Civil Rights, which publicly updates a list of breaches affecting 500 or more individuals here: https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf 

I also used 2021 population estimate data from the U.S. Census to quantify state impact: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-national-total.html

There are two types of investigations of HIPAA breaches: current/open and archive/closed. The latter contains an additional column of summaries of how the breach unfolded. The last segment of this project (stored in this repository) is the analysis I conducted to categorize hacking-related keywords in the summaries, in order to understand more recent trends in types of hacking incidents.
